## Requirements

- [docker](https://docs.docker.com/install/)
- [docker-compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/)
- [mkcert](https://github.com/FiloSottile/mkcert)
- [node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/)
- [yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/en/docs/install)

## Getting Started

The following steps will spin up a local dev server running over HTTPS

- Make sure the following line is in your **_/etc/hosts_** file:

```
127.0.0.1    localhost.change-me.com
```

- Run `mkcert -install` once to created a new local CA. This allows us to serve localhost over HTTPS.
- Run `make` to start local dev server at https://localhost.change-me.com
- Run `make stop` to stop local dev server

## Infrastructure

The `.iac` folder builds these AWS resources:

- ACM SSL Cert
- S3 for hosting static files
- Cloudfront for caching/SSL cert application
- Route 53 - for DNS routing
- IAM for CICD
